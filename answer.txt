I'm interested in taking DATA602 this semester because, it is the foundational course which is important to explore to the core of Data Science or Machine Learning. I would also like to learn the basic concepts from scratch so that it can help me achieve optimization when developing ML/DS models. In addition to these, I plan to solve some real-world, complex Data Science problems. So, considering all these, I'm interested in taking DATA602.
