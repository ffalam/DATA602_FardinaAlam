I'm really looking forward to taking DATA602 because I want to get a good handle on the basics of data science and explore all its corners. I've done quite a few data science projects, but there are still things I haven\'92t tried, like creating an SSH key. Even with the first homework, I've already picked up a lot, which just goes to show how much this course grabs my interest. I'm excited to see what else I'll learn.
